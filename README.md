*The C code above implements the following CPU Scheduling algorithms:*

1. First Come First Serve (FCFS) - Non-preemptive
2. Shortest Job First (SJF) - Non-preemptive
3. Shortest Time Remaining First (SRTF) - Preemptive
4. Priority Based Scheduling - Preemptive
5. Round Robin Scheduling - Preemptive
